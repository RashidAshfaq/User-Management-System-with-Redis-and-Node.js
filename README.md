🚀 Just Finished a New Project: User Management System with Redis and Node.js 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest project—a simple yet powerful User Management System built using Node.js, Redis, and Express, with Handlebars as the templating engine! 🛠️

🌟 Key Features:
Add New Users: Store user details (first name, last name, email, phone) in Redis using the efficient hash structure.
Search Users by ID: Retrieve user details instantly from Redis.
Edit User Information: Pre-fill user data into an edit form and update it with just a click.
Delete Users: Remove user data from Redis seamlessly.
🧠 What I Learned:
Redis Integration: Leveraged Redis for fast, in-memory data storage and retrieval, perfect for applications requiring high performance.
Express & Node.js: Enhanced my skills in building RESTful APIs and handling asynchronous operations in Node.js.
Handlebars Templating: Improved my ability to render dynamic views and handle user input using Handlebars.
Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to ensure smooth user experience.
🔍 Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: Redis
Templating Engine: Handlebars
Tools: Git, VS Code
🎯 Next Steps:
Adding user authentication and authorization.
Deploying the application to a cloud platform.
Integrating more advanced features like user roles and permissions.
